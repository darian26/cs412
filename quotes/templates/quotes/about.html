    <h1>About Sun Tzu</h1>

        Sun Tzu, also spelled Sunzi, was an ancient Chinese military strategist, philosopher, and general. He is best known for his work, <i>The Art of War</i>, which is considered one of the most important texts on strategy and warfare ever written. His principles on conflict, leadership, and strategy have been applied not only in military contexts but also in business, sports, and personal development.
